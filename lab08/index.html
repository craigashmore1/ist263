            <h2>Personal Info</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Craig Ashmore, and I am an undecided major. 
            I hope to transfer into the Ischool as I have experience working
            with communications equipment from the Army, building PC’s, and 
            writing code. Some of my accomplishments include the <strong> Expert Infantryman’s Badge</strong>, 
            obtaining the rank of <strong>Sergeant</strong>, and playing a season of golf for<strong> OCC</strong>. In terms of skills, 
            I bring a lot to the table, including leadership and communication. Outside of work and study,
            I golf a ton, like going to the beach, and I am from southern California.</p>

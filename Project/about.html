      <!-- Our Story -->
      <section class="about-content">
        <h1>Our Story</h1>

        <p>
          We’ve always believed that beer is more than just a drink, it’s a culture, a craft,
          and a way of bringing people together. From the clinking of pint glasses to the laughter
          shared in neighborhood pubs, beer has a special way of creating memories. We wanted to
          capture that spirit and carry it into a place that most people overlook: the restroom.
        </p>

        <p>
          That’s how the idea of the beer keg urinal was born. We realized there was something
          powerful about transforming an authentic stainless steel beer keg, a symbol of tradition,
          craftsmanship, and good times, into a functional piece of design that makes people smile
          every time they see it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our mission is simple: to blend the culture of beer with bold, functional design. Each keg
          urinal is carefully repurposed and finished by hand, ensuring it’s not only durable but also
          a true statement piece. Whether you run a busy brewery, a local pub, or just want to make
          your man cave legendary, our products bring personality and practicality together in one
          unforgettable package.
        </p>

        <p>
          We’re proud to give these kegs a second life, one that celebrates beer in a new and
          unexpected way. For us, it’s not just about making urinals, it’s about creating conversation
          starters, unforgettable experiences, and a touch of humor that makes your venue stand out.

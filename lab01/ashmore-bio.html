        Hello! My name is Craig Ashmore, and I am an undecided major. I hope to transfer into the Ischool as I have experience working with communications equipment from the Army, building PC’s, and writing code. Some of my accomplishments include the Expert Infantryman’s Badge, obtaining the rank of Sergeant, and playing a season of golf for OCC. In terms of skills, I bring a lot to the table, including leadership and communication. Outside of work and study, I golf a ton, like going to the beach, and am from southern California.
